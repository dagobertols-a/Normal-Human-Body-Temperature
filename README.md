# Normal-Human-Body-Temperature

###What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

## Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?


Here, I  will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

I am interested in these questions:

Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?

Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?
Remember that this is a condition for the central limit theorem, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply.

Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?

Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?

In this situation, is it appropriate to use the $t$ or $z$ statistic?

How is the result be different? Why?

What is  the difference in application of the $t$ and $z$ statistic?

At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?

Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?
